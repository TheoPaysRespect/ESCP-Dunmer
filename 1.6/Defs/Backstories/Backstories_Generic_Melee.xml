		<title>ash yam masher</title>
		<titleShort>masher</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] had always longed for one particular thing, potatoes, which proved somewhat difficult to obtain in Vvardenfell. [PAWN_pronoun] just wanted to feel them crumble beneath [PAWN_possessive] fists, to hear them cry out in pain as their life was extinguished, to smell their essence leave their shapeless forms. Sadly, ash yams would have to do.</description>

		<title>Arnesian War veteran</title>
		<titleShort>veteran</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the many brave Dunmer who fought in the Arnesian War. [PAWN_pronoun] was one of many who heroically stormed Black Marsh. And one of the few left standing in land now belonging to Morrowind. In later days, [PAWN_nameDef] took up gardening, but is still surprisingly quick on [PAWN_possessive] feet.</description>

		<title>ashlander</title>
		<titleShort>ashlander</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] used to be an ashlander from the Ahemmusa Tribe. [PAWN_nameDef] enjoyed living a relatively simple life, where death awaited around every corner. Though [PAWN_pronoun] eventually got sick of all the ash and blight storms, and decided to look for greener pastures, with actual grass.</description>

		<title>trophy hunter</title>

		<description>There are many great beasts in Morrowind, and [PAWN_nameDef] has hunted them all. On a quest for new challenges, [PAWN_pronoun] set sail to Solstheim. [PAWN_nameDef] hunted everything [PAWN_pronoun] found, from rieklings to grahl, and even an uderfrykte. However there was one elusive beast left on [PAWN_possessive] list, the werewolf.</description>

		<title>mud crab tracker</title>
		<titleShort>tracker</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] set off on a grand adventure, to retrieve [PAWN_pronoun] bottle of vintage greef, which went missing on a stormy night many moons ago.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] neighbour swears they saw a mudcrab wander off with it. Obviously the idea of a mudcrab breaking into ones home, climbing up the stairs, and reaching up to a shelf, all while avoiding making a single sound, is simply preposterous. But maybe there was some truth to it.\n\nOn [PAWN_possessive] journey, [PAWN_nameDef] learnt that many others have had bottles of alcohol stolen in the middle of the night. And all of them believe that a mudcrab is the culprit.\n\nSo now, [PAWN_nameDef] wanders the ashen wastes, the putrid swamps, and the fungal forest, all in search of that mudcrab.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was once a filthy degenerate, who would do anything for skooma, even commit murder. While committing a heinous crime [PAWN_possessive] life was almost lost. [PAWN_nameDef] was saved in an act of unexpected kindness. Afterwards, [PAWN_pronoun] vowed to commit [PAWN_objective]self to one goal. The protection of the Dunmeri people from a hellish abomination.</description>
