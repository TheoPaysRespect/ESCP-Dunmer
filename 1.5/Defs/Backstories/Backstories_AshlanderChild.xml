		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was abandoned in the ashlands shortly after [PAWN_possessive] birth. Luckily for [PAWN_nameDef], an Ashlander tribe passing through the area heard [PAWN_possessive] cries, and adopted [PAWN_nameDef] into the tribe. The tribe took great care of [PAWN_possessive], and passed on a great deal of their ancestral knowledge to [PAWN_nameDef].</description>

As [PAWN_pronoun] was serving such an important member of the tribe, it was integral that [PAWN_nameDef] made no mistake, as even a single one could prove devastating. At least that's what the wise-woman told [PAWN_possessive]. In reality [PAWN_pronoun] made plenty of mistakes, but the wise-woman would always ensure that [PAWN_nameDef] learnt from them.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was only really interested in one thing, and that was the idea of finding buried treasure. So naturally, [PAWN_pronoun] would wander off any chance [PAWN_pronoun] could find, and attempt start digging holes in the ash. [PAWN_nameDef] eventually became quite skilled at it, and often boasted that [PAWN_pronoun] had dug up half the ashlands. Of course [PAWN_nameDef] never actually found anything that one could consider treasure.</description>
