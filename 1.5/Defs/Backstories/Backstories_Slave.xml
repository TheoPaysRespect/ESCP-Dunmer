Enraged by the blight, and the sudden intrusion into their nest, the kwama swarmed slaves and slave masters alike. [PAWN_nameDef] only narrowly escaped with [PAWN_possessive] life.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>Many moons ago, [PAWN_nameDef] was a slave master at one of the many plantations found in Morrowind. One day, [PAWN_nameDef] suffered a rather serious head injury. Luckily [PAWN_pronoun] awoke fairly quickly, however [PAWN_pronoun] awoke surrounded by Argonian slaves.\n\nDue to some mild brain damage, [PAWN_nameDef] has since believed that [PAWN_pronoun] is in fact an Argonian. [PAWN_pronoun] spent many months tending the fields, alongside [PAWN_possessive] former slaves, now turned brothers in arms.\n\nEventually the plantation owner took pity on [PAWN_nameDef], and set [PAWN_objective] free.</baseDesc>
