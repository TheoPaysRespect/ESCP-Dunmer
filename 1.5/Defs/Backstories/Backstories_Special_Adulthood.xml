		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] may have 'borrowed' from a shop keeper in Vivec City. Turns out the shop keeper knew someone rather high up in the Morag Tong. Now [PAWN_nameDef] has fled for [PAWN_possessive] life, hoping that the Morag Tong won't follow.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was lead to believe [PAWN_pronoun] was The Incarnate. After seeking out the Urshilaku tribe, [PAWN_pronoun] managed to make it through the first two trials, and was then directed to find the Cavern of the Incarnate. [PAWN_nameDef] stood in front of the door for what felt like hours, waiting for the right moment to open the door.\n\nBut [PAWN_nameDef] never felt that moment come. Truth be told, [PAWN_pronoun] always had [PAWN_possessive] doubts, and was afraid of finding out the truth. The weight of the Dunmer was simply too much to bear. Sure, [PAWN_pronoun] had made it through the first two trials, but what if that was only through pure luck?\n\nSo [PAWN_nameDef] walked away.</description>
